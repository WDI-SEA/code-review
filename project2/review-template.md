## Review

#### Project Purpose

The purpose of this app is for the user to map a run in the Seattle area and have google streetview images appear to help the user visualize the run. 

#### Project Organization

#### Features

* Feature 1
  * There are two apis being called; one is for google maps and the other is for google street view images.

* Feature 2
  * The user can map a run and get images of that run to visualize the run.

* Feature 3
  * There are mulitple databases being uses, user, run, and userruns. User saves the login information for the user. Run stores paths made on google maps. Userruns saves a favorite run for a particular user. 

#### Areas of Success (Code, Organization)

* Attribute 1
  * The google apis are awesome, great job. It looks like a lot of code and complicated things but it's really well done. There were ajax calls all over this code and you did a really great job at organizing those calls. They can be very tricky sometimes and the code looks great.

* Attribute 2
  * Overall the idea to this app is great. This would be something that people would actually use. The pitch for an idea like this is how real companies get started.

#### Areas for Improvement (Code, Organization)

* Attribute 1
  * There was a lot of javaScript in ejs files. Like a ton, so keeping those in their own files would be ideal. 

* Attribute 2
  * Your CSS needs some work. It has a simplistic logic to it and I can totally dig that, but it needs some tlc. There is something called OOCSS, object oriented css, and it's great. There were mulitple times when you used mulitple ids for the same CSS stylings. This could be solve by orgainizing your CSS into classes and not reliying on using ids all the html elements. OOCSS could simplify your code in your stylesheets.

## Additional Notes

Great job dude, this is a really cool project.
