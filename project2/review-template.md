## Review

#### Project Purpose

A current events aggrigator that pulls topics from different user-selected online news/media sources. 

#### Project Organization

#### Features

* User login
  * Passport authentication to create a user account and customize your preferred media outlets
* NY Times and Guardian news APIs
  * Allows the user to query both news outlet databases. News headlines matching the search term are returned with links to the story. 
* Search history
  * I seems that learning RoR has made me completely forget Express, so I couldn't get the database up and running locally and I couldn't make and account and log in. But from what it looks like in the code, the user's search queries are saved and stored in their user profile. That way, I can be regularly up-to-date with my favorite #ConquistadorTrump news. 

#### Areas of Success (Code, Organization)

* Controller organization
  * Nice job making a seperate controller for your pages instead of dumping it in you index.js (like I did). Kinda related -- A+ organzation on the views.
* DRY
  * Everthing is super-clean and pretty readable. As I mentioned before, Node was misbehaving with getting a DB up and running so I never logged in, but your code was nice and neat so I got a great idea of the features. 
*

#### Areas for Improvement (Code, Organization)

* Readme
  * Could use some explanation for what the project is/how to use it, maybe a link to a demo
* UI
  * Give it some good ol' flair! But since it's a info-heavy website, it doesn't need much.

## Additional Notes

A great beginning to something I'd find useful. I'd definitely want something like this to be my homepage.
