## Project Repo

_https://colordat.herokuapp.com/_

## Review

#### Project Purpose

_Colordat allows you to search Amazon for home decor products by color and save products to a board to access later._

#### Project Organization

#### Features

* Features
  * Ryan's app will allow a user to sign in and save the products of their choice'
  * this is implemented with models tables and validations
  * His app also uses the Amazon api. This is great. He also got the image and price to show up on the boards show page. He achieved this with migrations and models.  

#### Areas of Success (Code, Organization)

* His whole project is a success! His code seems very well organized and the front end looks really nice and slick. 
#### Areas for Improvement (Code, Organization)

* The search results where sometimes questionable. For example some of the items where not even close to the color typed in.

## Additional Notes

_Ryan's project turned out great. It's obvious he spend a lot of time and effort to create this beautiful app._
