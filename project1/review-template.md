## Review

#### Project Purpose

Travis recreated the game Yahtzee using Javascript, JQuery, and Bootstrap. 

#### Project Organization
This project included an html, css, and js file and a folder of images.

#### Features

* Roll dice
  * Clicking the "Roll Dice" button would change the face values of the 5 dice.
  * An event listener was attached to the roll button. Then multiple if statements were used that referenced the "Player" object's key value pairs and randomized the dice. A for...in loop was used to set the number of times the dice could be rolled and to display the correct dice image.

* Determine if a small straight or other play had been achieved.
  * First a new array was created. Then a for...in loop was used to find the dice that were rolled and push those values into the array. Then the array was turned into a string, and was "tested" against a regular expression to see if there was a match. If true, an if/else statement added points to the appropriate table cell on the gameboard.

* Adding scores to the scoreboard
  * After a player is done rolling, they click on a cell in the board to add the points from their turn. The points are automatically calculated and appear. Oh my!
  * The total score was generated by assigning table cells to an array and then looping through it to get their values.  

#### Areas of Success (Code, Organization)

* Well organized HTMl
  * The html document was very clean, well organized, and efficient. No extra fluff and well indented. 
* Well-named variables, classes, and IDs
  * The classes, IDs, and variable names made it much easier to follow the logic. Nice work!
* Diverse set of code
  * An impressive amount and complexity of code was used including regular expressions, for...in loops, different types of event listeners, dynamically created arrays, and use of "this."

#### Areas for Improvement (Code, Organization)

* Explanatory comments in app.js
  * Adding explanatory comments to the javascript file will help in reviewing the code and when coming back to it in the future. 
  * Console logs could be commented out or removed.
* Styling and responsiveness
  * Adding additional styling to the page.
  * Making use of bootstrap's column feature (i.e. 'col-md-12') would help with responsiveness.

## Additional Notes

* You are a brave man for tackling this game. It's a complex beast, to say the lease. Nice job!
